# datafun-07-ml
## Project 07 for 44608 focusing on machine learning.

## Initiate project 07 repository in GitHub

### Clone GitHub repository to local machine

```zsh 
git clone https://github.com/ForeverGrateful70/datafun-07-ml.git
```

### Create a README, .gitignore and requirements.txt files

## Create Virtual Environment
```zsh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Git Commands in terminal
```zsh
git add .
git commit -m "msg"
git push -u origin main
```

## Install Dependencies in terminal 

```zsh 
python3 -m pip install jupyterlab pandas pyarrow matplotlib seaborn scipy numpy scikit-learn
python3 -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Freeze Requirements
```zsh
python3 -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Import Dependencies
```zsh
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import pyarrow as pa
import numpy as np
import scipy
import sklearn
```

## Follow These Steps to Complete Project 07

### Part One: Chart a Straight Line
#### Follow instructions from textbook Intro to Python for Computer Science and Data Science on page 414, Chapter 10.16. Utilize markdown cells to create section headings as you work.

### Part Two: Predictions
#### Follow instructions from the textbook Intro to Python for Computer Science and Data Science on page 416, Chapter 10.16. Utilize markdown cells to create section headings as you go. There will be a total of seven sections created while working through the data:
##### Section One: Data Acquisition
##### Section Two: Data Inspection
##### Section Three: Data Cleaning
##### Section Four: Descriptive Statistics
##### Section Five: Build the Model
##### Section Six: Predictions
##### Section Seveb: Visualizations

### Part Three: Predictions
#### Follow instructions from the textbook Intro to Python for Computer Science and Data Science on page 620, Chapter 15.4. Utilize markdown cells to create section headings as you go. There will be a total of four sections created while working through the data. Remember that in Part 2 you aquired, inspected, cleaned, and ran descriptive statistics on the dataset.
##### Sectiion One: Build the Model
##### Section Two: Test the Model
##### Section Three: Predictions
##### Section Four: Visualizations

### Part Four: Insights
#### Discuss the two different methods (statistical and machine learning) used in this project to visualize the data and find the linear regression line.

### Complete Project 07
```zsh
git add .
git commit -m "final"                         
git push origin main
```

### Summary
#### This is a professional project using Jupyter Lab following instructions from the textbook Intro to Python for Computer Science and Data Science. The focus of this project is to use and compare statistical linear regression models and machine learning predictive abilities.
